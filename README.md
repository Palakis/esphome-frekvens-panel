# esphome-frekvens-component

A custom component for esp-home to interface with IKEA's Frekvens Cube.

## Sources

This repo is heavily based on the original [FrekvensPanel library by @frumperino](https://github.com/frumperino/FrekvensPanel).

It's also inspired from the esphome component PCD8544.

## Usage

Currently there is a dependency upon Adafruit GFX library. In your esphome config, add these lines:

- Declare necessary libraries
- Define frekvenspanel component

Here is a short config to demonstrate the usage to display time on panel:

```yaml
esphome:
  name: frekvens8266-weather
  platform: ESP8266
  board: d1_mini
  platformio_options:
    upload_speed: 115200
    lib_deps:
      - Wire                            # Also required by GFX.
      - SPI                             # Also required by GFX.
      - adafruit/Adafruit GFX Library   # Required for FrekvensPanel.
      - Adafruit BusIO                  # Required by GFX Library.
      - me-no-dev/ESPAsyncTCP

    lambda: |-
      auto time = id(ntp_time).now();
      it.printf(0, 0, id(b03), "%d:%d", time.hour, time.minute);

```
